# 2c) Honeycomb Holstein Model with Checkpointing
Download this example as a [Julia script](../assets/scripts/tutorials/holstein_honeycomb_checkpoint.jl).

In this tutorial we demonstrate how to introduce checkpointing to the previous
[2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial, allowing for simulations to be
resumed if terminated prior to completion.

## Import packages
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous
[2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial.

## Specify simulation parameters
Compared to the previous [2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial, we have added
two new keyword arguments to the `run_simulation` function:
- `checkpoint_freq`: When going to write a new checkpoint file, only write one if more than `checkpoint_freq` hours have passed since the last checkpoint file was written.
- `runtime_limit`: If after writing a new checkpoint file more than `runtime_limit` hours have passed since the simulation started, terminate the simulation.
The `runtime_limit = Inf` default behavior means there is no runtime limit for the simulation.

````julia
# Top-level function to run simulation.
function run_simulation(
    comm::MPI.Comm; # MPI communicator.
    # KEYWORD ARGUMENTS
    sID, # Simulation ID.
    Ω, # Phonon energy.
    α, # Electron-phonon coupling.
    μ, # Chemical potential.
    L, # System size.
    β, # Inverse temperature.
    N_therm, # Number of thermalization updates.
    N_updates, # Total number of measurements and measurement updates.
    N_bins, # Number of times bin-averaged measurements are written to file.
    checkpoint_freq, # Frequency with which checkpoint files are written in hours.
    runtime_limit = Inf, # Simulation runtime limit in hours.
    Δτ = 0.05, # Discretization in imaginary time.
    n_stab = 10, # Numerical stabilization period in imaginary-time slices.
    δG_max = 1e-6, # Threshold for numerical error corrected by stabilization.
    symmetric = false, # Whether symmetric propagator definition is used.
    checkerboard = false, # Whether checkerboard approximation is used.
    seed = abs(rand(Int)), # Seed for random number generator.
    filepath = "." # Filepath to where data folder will be created.
)
````

## Initialize simulation
We need to make a few modifications to this portion of the code as compared to the previous tutorial
in order for checkpointing to work. First, we record need to record the simulation start time,
which we do by initializing a variable `start_timestamp = time()`.
Second, we need to convert the `checkpoint_freq` and `runtime_limit` from hours to seconds.

````julia
    # Record when the simulation began.
    start_timestamp = time()

    # Convert runtime limit from hours to seconds.
    runtime_limit = runtime_limit * 60.0^2

    # Convert checkpoint frequency from hours to seconds.
    checkpoint_freq = checkpoint_freq * 60.0^2

    # Construct the foldername the data will be written to.
    datafolder_prefix = @sprintf "holstein_honeycomb_w%.2f_a%.2f_mu%.2f_L%d_b%.2f" Ω α μ L β

    # Get MPI process ID.
    pID = MPI.Comm_rank(comm)

    # Initialize simulation info.
    simulation_info = SimulationInfo(
        filepath = filepath,
        datafolder_prefix = datafolder_prefix,
        sID = sID,
        pID = pID
    )

    # Initialize the directory the data will be written to.
    initialize_datafolder(comm, simulation_info)
````

## Initialize simulation metadata
At this point we need to introduce branching logic to handle whether a new simulation is being started,
or a previous simulation is being resumed.
We do this by checking the `simulation_info.resuming` boolean value.
If `simulation_info.resuming = true`, then we are resuming a previous simulation, while
`simulation_info.resuming = false` indicates we are starting a new simulation.
Therefore, the section of code immediately below handles the case that we are starting a new simulation.

We also introduce and initialize two new variables `n_therm = 1` and `n_updates = 1` which will keep track
of how many rounds of thermalization and measurement updates have been performed. These two variables will
needed to be included in the checkpoint files we write later in the simulation, as they will indicate
where to resume a previously terminated simulation.

````julia
    # If starting a new simulation i.e. not resuming a previous simulation.
    if !simulation_info.resuming

        # Begin thermalization updates from start.
        n_therm = 1

        # Begin measurement updates from start.
        n_updates = 1

        # Initialize random number generator
        rng = Xoshiro(seed)

        # Initialize additiona_info dictionary
        metadata = Dict()

        # Record simulation parameters.
        metadata["N_therm"] = N_therm
        metadata["N_updates"] = N_updates
        metadata["N_bins"] = N_bins
        metadata["n_stab"] = n_stab
        metadata["dG_max"] = δG_max
        metadata["symmetric"] = symmetric
        metadata["checkerboard"] = checkerboard
        metadata["seed"] = seed
        metadata["hmc_acceptance_rate"] = 0.0
        metadata["reflection_acceptance_rate"] = 0.0
        metadata["swap_acceptance_rate"] = 0.0

## Write first checkpoint
This section of code needs to be added so that a first checkpoint file is written before
beginning a new simulation. We do this using the [`write_jld2_checkpoint`](@ref) function.
This function all return the epoch timestamp `checkpoint_timestamp` corresponding to when
the checkpoint file was written.

````julia
        # Write initial checkpoint file.
        checkpoint_timestamp = write_jld2_checkpoint(
            comm,

            checkpoint_freq = checkpoint_freq,

            # Contents of checkpoint file below.

            measurement_container, model_geometry, metadata, rng
        )

## Load checkpoint
If we are resuming a simulation that was previously terminated prior to completion, then
we need to load the most recent checkpoint file using the [`read_jld2_checkpoint`](@ref) function.
The cotents of the checkpoint file are returned as a dictionary `checkpoint` by the [`read_jld2_checkpoint`](@ref) function.
We then extract the cotents of the checkpoint file from the `checkpoint` dictionary.

````julia
    # If resuming a previous simulation.
    else

        # Load the checkpoint file.
        checkpoint, checkpoint_timestamp = read_jld2_checkpoint(simulation_info)

## Thermalize system
The first change we need to make to this section is to have the for-loop iterate from `n_therm:N_therm` instead of `1:N_therm`.
The other change we need make to this section of the code from the previous [1b) Square Hubbard Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial
is to add a call to the [`write_jld2_checkpoint`](@ref) function at the end of each iteration of the
for-loop in which we perform the thermalization updates.
When calling this function we need to pass it the timestamp for the previous checkpoint `checkpoint_timestamp`
so that the function can determine if a new checkpoint file needs to be written.
If a new checkpoint file is written then the `checkpoint_timestamp` variable will be updated to reflect this,
otherwise it will remain unchanged.

## Make measurements
Again, we need to modify the for-loop so that it runs from `n_updates:N_updates` instead of `1:N_updates`.
The only other change we need to make to this section of the code from the previous
[2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial
is to add a call to the [`write_jld2_checkpoint`](@ref) function at the end of each iteration of the
for-loop in which we perform updates and measurements.
Note that we set `n_therm = N_therm + 1` when writing the checkpoint file to ensure that when the simulation
is resumed the thermalization updates are not repeated.

## Merge binned data
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous [2a) Honeycomb Holstein Model](@ref) tutorial.

````julia
    # Merge binned data into a single HDF5 file.
    merge_bins(simulation_info)
````

## Record simulation metadata
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous
[2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial.

````julia
    # Calculate acceptance rates.
    metadata["hmc_acceptance_rate"] /= (N_updates + N_therm)
    metadata["reflection_acceptance_rate"] /= (N_updates + N_therm)
    metadata["swap_acceptance_rate"] /= (N_updates + N_therm)

    # Record largest numerical error encountered during simulation.
    metadata["dG"] = δG

    # Write simulation metadata to simulation_info.toml file.
    save_simulation_info(simulation_info, metadata)
````

## Post-process results
From the last [2b) Honeycomb Holstein Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial, we now recommend adding
a call to the [`rename_complete_simulation`](@ref) function once the results are processed.
This function renames the data folder to begin with `complete_*`, making it simple to identify which
simulations ran to completion and which ones need to be resumed from the last checkpoint file.
This function also deletes the checkpoint files that were written during the simulation.

````julia
    # Process the simulation results, calculating final error bars for all measurements.
    # writing final statisitics to CSV files.
    process_measurements(
        comm,
        datafolder = simulation_info.datafolder,
        n_bins = N_bins,
        export_to_csv = true,
        scientific_notation = false,
        decimals = 7,
        delimiter = " "
    )

    # Calculate CDW correlation ratio.
    Rcdw, ΔRcdw = compute_composite_correlation_ratio(
        datafolder = simulation_info.datafolder,
        name = "cdw",
        type = "equal-time",
        q_point = (0, 0),
        q_neighbors = [
            (1,0),   (0,1),   (1,1),
            (L-1,0), (0,L-1), (L-1,L-1)
        ]
    )

    # Record the AFM correlation ratio mean and standard deviation.
    metadata["Rcdw_mean_real"] = real(Rcdw)
    metadata["Rcdw_mean_imag"] = imag(Rcdw)
    metadata["Rcdw_std"]       = ΔRcdw

    # Write simulation summary TOML file.
    save_simulation_info(simulation_info, metadata)

    # Rename the data folder to indicate the simulation is complete.
    simulation_info = rename_complete_simulation(
        comm, simulation_info,
        delete_jld2_checkpoints = true
    )

    return nothing
end # end of run_simulation function
````

## Execute script
To execute the script, we have added two new command line arguments allowing for the assignment of both
the `checkpoint_freq` and `runtime_limit` values.
Therefore, a simulation can be run with the command
```bash
mpiexecjl -n 16 julia holstein_honeycomb_checkpoint.jl 1 1.0 1.5 0.0 3 4.0 5000 10000 100 0.5
```
or
```bash
srun julia holstein_honeycomb_checkpoint.jl 1 1.0 1.5 0.0 3 4.0 5000 10000 100 0.5
```
Refer to the previous [1b) Square Hubbard Model with MPI Parallelization](@ref) tutorial for more details on how to run the simulation
script using MPI.

In the example calls above the code will write a new checkpoint if more than 30 minutes (0.5 hours) has passed since the last checkpoint file was written.
Note that these same commands are used to both begin a new simulation and also resume a previous simulation.
This is a useful feature when submitting jobs on a cluster, as it allows the same job file to be used for
both starting new simulations and resuming ones that still need to finish.
