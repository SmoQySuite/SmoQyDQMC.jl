# 1d) Square Hubbard Model with Density Tuning
In this example we demonstrate how to introduce chemical potential and density tuning to the previous
[1c) Square Hubbard Model with Checkpointing](@ref) tutorial.
Specifically, we show how to use the algorithm introduced in
[Phys. Rev. E 105, 045311](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.045311)
for dynamically adjusting the chemical potential during the simulation in order to achieve a target
electron density or filling fraction.

Note that when you dope the Hubbard model away from half-filling a sign problem is introduced.
As with making measurements, if the sign problem becomes severe the density tuning algorithm will
become very inefficient as simply providing an accurate measurement of the density and
compressibility (which is used to adjust the chemical potential) will become challenging.

## Import Packages
Compared to the previouse [1c) Square Hubbard Model with Checkpointing](@ref) tutorial,
we now need to import the [MuTuner.jl](https://github.com/cohensbw/MuTuner.jl.git)
package, which is reexported by [SmoQyDQMC.jl](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl.git)

````julia
using SmoQyDQMC
import SmoQyDQMC.LatticeUtilities as lu
import SmoQyDQMC.JDQMCFramework as dqmcf
import SmoQyDQMC.MuTuner as mt

using Random
using Printf
using MPI

## Specify simulation parameters
Here we introduce the keyword argument `n` to the `run_simulation` function
which specifies the target electron density we want to achieve in the simulation.
Now the `μ` argument specifies the initial chemical potential we begin the simulation with,
but of course it will be adjusted during the simulation to achieve the target density `n`.

## Initialize simulation
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous
[1c) Square Hubbard Model with Checkpointing](@ref) tutorial.

in the metadata dictionary.

## Make measurements
Here we need to add a call to the [`update_chemical_potential!`](@ref) function
after making and writing measurements but before writing the checkpoint file is written.
And again, we need to make sure the include the `chemical_potential_tuner` in the checkpoint file.

## Merge binned data
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous [1a) Square Hubbard Model](@ref) tutorial.

## Record simulation metadata
Here we can add a call to the [`save_density_tuning_profile`](@ref), which records the full history
of the chemical potential and density tuning process.

## Post-process results
No changes need to made to this section of the code from the previous
[1c) Square Hubbard Model with Checkpointing](@ref) tutorial.

## Execute script
Here we add an additional command line argument to specify the target density `n` we want to achieve in the simulation.
Now the `μ` command line argument specifies the initial chemical potential we begin the simulation with.
For instance, a simulation can be run with the command
```bash
mpiexecjl -n 16 julia hubbard_square_density_tuning.jl 1 5.0 -0.25 0.8 0.0 4 4.0 2500 10000 100 1.0
```
or
```bash
srun julia hubbard_square_density_tuning.jl 1 5.0 -0.25 0.8 0.0 4 4.0 2500 10000 100 1.0
```
where the target density is ``\langle n \rangle = 0.8`` and the initial chemical potential is ``\mu = 0.0``.
