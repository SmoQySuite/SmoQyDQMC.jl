    SimulationInfo

Contains identification information about simulation, including the location data is written to,
the simulation ID, and MPI process ID, and whether this simulation started a new simulation or resumed
a previous simulation.

# Fields

- `filepath::String`: File path to where data folder lives.
- `datafolder_prefix`: Prefix for the data folder name.
- `datafolder_name::String`: The data folder name, given by `$(datafolder_prefix)_$(sID)`.
- `datafolder::String`: The data folder, including filepath, given by `joinpath(filepath, datafolder_name)`.
- `pID::Int`: MPI process ID, defaults to 0 if MPI not being used.
- `sID::Int`: Simulation ID.
- `write_bins_concurrent::Bool`: Whether binned data will be written to HDF5 during the simulation or held in memory until the end of the simulation.
- `bin_files::Vector{Vector{UInt8}}`: Represents the HDF5 files containing the binned data.
- `resuming::Bool`: Whether current simulation is resuming a previous simulation (`true`) or starting a new one (`false`).
- `smoqy_version::VersionNumber`: Version of [SmoQyDQMC.jl](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl) used in simulation.

# Notes

If `write_bins_concurrent = true`, then the elements of `bin_files` correspond to the HDF5 bin filenames, assuming the vector elements are converted to strings.
If `write_bins_concurrent = false`, then the elements of the `bin_files` correspond to a byte vector representation of a HDF5 file containing the binned data.
For small simulations that run very fast setting `write_bins_concurrent = false` can make sense, as it significantly reduces the frequency of file IO during the simulation.
This can cause issues on some clusters with respect to overtaxing the cluster network if data is being written to file too frequently during the simulation.
However, for most larger simulations it is advisable to set `write_bins_concurrent = true` as this significantly reduces the memory footprint of the simulation,
particularly when making time-displaced correlation measurements. Also, setting `write_bins_concurrent = false` dramatically increases the size of the checkpoint
files if checkpointing is occurring during the simulation, as the checkpoint files now need to contain all the binned data collected during the simulation.
