# # Honeycomb Holstein Model

# In this example we will work through simulating the Holstein model on a honeycomb lattice.
# The Holstein Hamiltonian is given by
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# \hat{H} = & -t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle, \sigma} (\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{\sigma,i}, \hat{c}^{\phantom \dagger}_{\sigma,j} + {\rm h.c.})
# - \mu \sum_{i,\sigma} \hat{n}_{\sigma,i} \\
# & + \frac{1}{2} M \Omega^2 \sum_{i} \hat{X}_i^2 + \sum_i \frac{1}{2M} \hat{P}_i^2
# + \alpha \sum_i \hat{X}_i (\hat{n}_{\uparrow,i} + \hat{n}_{\downarrow,i} - 1)
# \end{align*}
# ```
# where ``\hat{c}^\dagger_{\sigma,i} \ (\hat{c}^{\phantom \dagger}_{\sigma,i})`` creates (annihilates) a spin ``\sigma``
# electron on site ``i`` in the lattice, and ``\hat{n}_{\sigma,i} = \hat{c}^\dagger_{\sigma,i} \hat{c}^{\phantom \dagger}_{\sigma,i}``
# is the spin-``\sigma`` electron number operator for site ``i``. Here ``\mu`` is the chemical potential and  ``t`` is the nearest-neighbor
# hopping amplitude, with the sum over ``\langle i,j \rangle`` denoting a sum over all nearest-neighbor pairs of sites.
# A local dispersionless phonon mode is then placed on each site in the lattice, with ``\hat{X}_i`` and ``\hat{P}_i`` the corresponding
# phonon position and momentum operator on site ``i`` in the lattice. The phonon mass and energy are denoted ``M`` and ``\Omega`` respectively.
# Lastly, the phonon displacement ``\hat{X}_i`` couples to the total local density ``\hat{n}_{\uparrow,i} + \hat{n}_{\downarrow,i},`` with the
# parameter ``\alpha`` controlling the strength of this coupling.

# ## [Setup EFA-HMC Updates](@id holstein_square_efa-hmc_updates)

# Before we begin the simulation, we also want to initialize an instance of the
# [`EFAHMCUpdater`](@ref) type, which will be used to perform hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)
# udpates to the phonon fields that use exact fourier acceleration (EFA)
# to further reduce autocorrelation times.

# The two main parameters that need to be specified are the time-step size ``\Delta t`` and number of time-steps ``N_t``
# performed in the HMC update, with the corresponding integrated trajectory time then equalling ``T_t = N_t \cdot \Delta t.``
# Note that the computational cost of an HMC update is linearly proportional to ``N_t,`` while the acceptance rate is inversely
# proportional to ``\Delta t.``

# [Previous studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723) have shown that a good place to start
# with the integrated trajectory time ``T_t`` is a quarter the period of the bare phonon mode,
# ``T_t \approx \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{2\pi}{\Omega} \right) = \pi/(2\Omega).``
# It is also important to keep the acceptance rate for the HMC updates above ``\sim 90\%`` to help prevent numerical instabilities from occuring.

# Based on user experience, a good (conservative) starting place is to set the number of time-step to ``N_t \approx 10,``
# and then set the time-step size to ``\Delta t \approx \pi/(2\Omega N_t),``
# effectively setting the integrated trajectory time to ``T_t = \pi/(2\Omega).``
# Then, if the acceptance rate is too low you increase ``N_t,`` which results in a reduction of ``\Delta t.``
# Conversely, if the acceptance rate is very high ``(\gtrsim 99 \% )`` it can be useful to decrease ``N_t``,
# thereby increasing ``\Delta t,`` as this will reduce the computational cost of performing an EFA-HMC update.

# > julia holstein_honeycomb.jl 1 1.0 1.5 0.0 3 4.0 5000 10000 100
# ```
# runs a DQMC simulation of a Holstein model on a ``3 \times 3`` unit cell (`N = 2 \times 3^2 = 18` site) honeycomb lattice
# at half-filling ``(\mu = 0)`` and inverse temperature ``\beta = 4.0``.
# The phonon energy is set to ``\Omega = 1.0`` and the electron-phonon coupling is set to ``\alpha = 1.5.``
# In the DQMC simulation, 5,000 EFA-HMC, reflection and swap updates are performed to thermalize the system.
# Then an additional 10,000 such udpates are performed, after each of set of which measurements are made.
# During the simulation, bin-averaged measurements are written to file 100 times,
# with each bin of data containing the average of 10,000/100 = 100 sequential measurements.
